EHT-HOPS (or *ehthops*) is a data calibration pipeline that uses the Haystack Observatory Preprocessing System (HOPS) and the EHT Analysis Toolkit (EAT) to reduce data from millimetre Very Long Baseline Interferometry (mm-VLBI) observations.

For details, refer to `Blackburn et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...23B/abstract>`_.

This documentation explains the steps necessary to install and run the ehthops pipeline.
