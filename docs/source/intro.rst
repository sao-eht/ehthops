Introduction to ehthops
=======================

ehthops is a data calibration pipeline that uses the Haystack Observatory Preprocessing System (HOPS) and the EHT Analysis Toolkit (EAT) for calibrating millimetre-VLBI data,
with a focus on the Event Horizon Telescope.

For details, refer to `Blackburn et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...23B/abstract>`_.

This documentation explains the steps necessary for installing and running the ehthops pipeline, with some settings and steps tailored to 2021 data.
