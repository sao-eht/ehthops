* Ensure these settings are captured regardless of control-file concatenation order by introducing an (effectively) "if true" statement
if scan > 001-000000

* Global commands that won't affect fringe search
weak_channel  0.0           * don't mark weak channels

* More global commands
optimize_closure true   * minimize the contribution of non-closing delay
pc_mode          manual * use manual phase-cal phase

* Set up reasonable windows
sb_win -0.150 0.150   * reasonable single band delay search window in us
mb_win -1.000 1.000 * reasonable multiband delay search window in us
dr_win -1.e-6 1.e-6 * reasonable delay-rate search window in us/s
